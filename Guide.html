  <h1> Official Historically Accurate Pong Guide (Desktop Version 1.1)  </h1> 

<h2> Introduction and Other Important Info </h2>
  
<p> 

  This is a large scale recreation of the original Pong game. The basic controls are pressing the A/D or Left/Right Arrow keys to make your paddle move left or right respectively. The top paddle is yours and the bottom paddle is controlled by a simple AI I made. This AI paddle isn't anywhere near perfect so if it messes up just list what happened in a feedback response.
  just below this text you will find a spread sheet containing all the sound effects in the game and their raritys. After that all the controls for the game are listed. Finally, this guide ends with some helpful tips and credits.

<h4> Helpful Tips and Closing Statements </h4>

<p> Thanks to anyone who actually read this far into my guide and for playing my game. I actually enjoy working on this game however I do have an actual life as well. This means that this game won't usually get consistent updates
As a special treat to those who have read this far I have listed some helpful tips below.

</p>

<ul>  

  <li> Remember that the game will always start with the ball going to the left corner. I wish I could make this randomized but with the way that the scoring system works to make the game harder as it goes on it just wouldn't work for the ball to go into the right corner sometimes.</li>
  <li> If were being honest, a lot of the sound effects in this game are very loud. This can sometimes be distracting so I would recommend either using the volume slider to turn the volume down or just muting your device while you play. </li>
  <li> As I mentioned before, this game would be very hard to keep working if every thing was randomized. With this being said always remember that the entire game runs in a linear path. This means if you fail just remember that it will be the same way the next time you play unless something goes wrong. </li>

</ul>
